Kitty Kinematics – A Quantum Quorum Creation

Have you ever wondered what would happen if a cat could fly? Well, thanks to the minds at Quantum Quorum, physics society of GTBIT that loves turning physics into fun, we bring you Kitty Kinematics — a game where wind decides the flight of Simba, cat found near the canteen.

Simba flies over the objects found near the canteen. The wind speed fluctuates, affecting how Simba moves

How far can you go before wind resistance or canteen obstacles bring Simba back down to Earth?

Developed by Quantum Quorum, this game isn’t just fun—it’s physics in action! So, are you ready to put your knowledge (and skills) to the test? Let’s fly!
